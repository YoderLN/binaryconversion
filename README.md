# binaryconversion

Goal is to create a simple tool for easy conversions between hex, decimal and  binary.
Largely just to prove that I can build something to accomplish this.
Version 1 accepts a string of 1s and 0s and returns the int representation.

Future improvements: switching from hard code to user input, conversion from decimal to binary, write hex conversion, include menu to allow choice between functionality.
Maybe a GUI if I can figure out how to do that.
